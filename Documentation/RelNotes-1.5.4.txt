========================

Updates since v1.5.3

   export-subst attribute.

 * git-for-each-ref learned %(xxxdate:<dateformat>) syntax to
   show the various date fields in different formats.

 * git-gc --auto is a low-impact way to automatically run a

   (read: safer than the usual one) after the user accumulates
   too many loose objects.

   if a push is run.
