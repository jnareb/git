GIT v1.5.4.4 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.4.3
--------------------

 * Building and installing with an overtight umask such as 077 made
   installed templates unreadable by others, while the rest of the install
   are done in a way that is friendly to umask 022.

 * "git cvsexportcommit -w $cvsdir" misbehaved when GIT_DIR is set to a
   relative directory.

 * "git http-push" had an invalid memory access that could lead it to
   segfault.

 * When "git rebase -i" gave control back to the user for a commit that is
   marked to be edited, it just said "modify it with commit --amend",
   without saying what to do to continue after modifying it.  Give an
   explicit instruction to run "rebase --continue" to be more helpful.

 * "git send-email" in 1.5.4.3 issued a bogus empty In-Reply-To: header.

 * "git bisect" showed mysterious "won't bisect on seeked tree" error message.
   This was leftover from Cogito days to prevent "bisect" starting from a
   cg-seeked state.  We still keep the Cogito safety, but running "git bisect
   start" when another bisect was in effect will clean up and start over.

 * "git push" with an explicit PATH to receive-pack did not quite work if
   receive-pack was not on usual PATH.  We earlier fixed the same issue
   with "git fetch" and upload-pack, but somehow forgot to do so in the
   other direction.

 * git-gui's info dialog was not displayed correctly when the user tries
   to commit nothing (i.e. without staging anything).

 * "git revert" did not properly fail when attempting to run with a
   dirty index.

Also included are a handful documentation updates.
