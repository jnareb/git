GIT v1.5.4.4 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.4.3
--------------------

 * "git cvsexportcommit -w $cvsdir" misbehaved when GIT_DIR is set to a
   relative directory.

 * "git http-push" had an invalid memory access that could lead it to
   segfault.

 * When "git rebase -i" gave control back to the user for a commit that is
   marked to be edited, it just said "modify it with commit --amend",
   without saying what to do to continue after modifying it.  Give an
   explicit instruction to run "rebase --continue" to be more helpful.

 * "git send-email" in 1.5.4.3 issued a bogus empty In-Reply-To: header.

Also included are a handful documentation updates.
