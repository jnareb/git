git-fast-export(1)
==================

NAME
----
git-fast-export - Git data exporter


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-fast-export [options]' | 'git-fast-import'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This program dumps the given revisions in a form suitable to be piped
into gitlink:git-fast-import[1].

You can use it as a human readable bundle replacement (see
gitlink:git-bundle[1]), or as a kind of an interactive
gitlink:git-filter-branch[1].


OPTIONS
-------
--progress=<n>::
	Insert 'progress' statements every <n> objects, to be shown by
	gitlink:git-fast-import[1] during import.

--signed-tags=(verbatim|warn|strip|abort)::
	Specify how to handle signed tags.  Since any transformation
	after the export can change the tag names (which can also happen
	when excluding revisions) the signatures will not match.
+
When asking to 'abort' (which is the default), this program will die
when encountering a signed tag.  With 'strip', the tags will be made
unsigned, with 'verbatim', they will be silently exported
and with 'warn', they will be exported, but you will see a warning.


EXAMPLES
--------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
$ git fast-export --all | (cd /empty/repository && git fast-import)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This will export the whole repository and import it into the existing
empty repository.  Except for reencoding commits that are not in
UTF-8, it would be a one-to-one mirror.

-----------------------------------------------------
$ git fast-export master~5..master |
	sed "s|refs/heads/master|refs/heads/other|" |
	git fast-import
-----------------------------------------------------

This makes a new branch called 'other' from 'master~5..master'
(i.e. if 'master' has linear history, it will take the last 5 commits).

Note that this assumes that none of the blobs and commit messages
referenced by that revision range contains the string
'refs/heads/master'.


Limitations
-----------

Since gitlink:git-fast-import[1] cannot tag trees, you will not be
able to export the linux-2.6.git repository completely, as it contains
a tag referencing a tree instead of a commit.
