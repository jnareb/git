GIT v1.6.0.5 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.0.4
--------------------

* 'git checkout' used to crash when your HEAD was pointing at a deleted
  branch.

* 'git checkout' from an un-checked-out state did not allow switching out
  of the current branch.

* 'git diff' always allowed GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF and --no-ext-diff was no-op for
  the command.

* 'git fast-export' did not export all tags.

* 'git ls-files --with-tree=<tree>' did not work with options other
  than -c, most notably with -m.

* 'git pack-objects' did not make its best effort to honor --max-pack-size
  option when a single first object already busted the given limit and
  placed many objects in a single pack.

* 'git-p4' fast import frontend was too eager to trigger its keyword expansion
  logic, even on a keyword-looking string that does not have closing '$' on the
  same line.

* 'git push $there' when the remote $there is defined in $GIT_DIR/branches/$there
  behaves more like what cg-push from Cogito used to work.

* 'git tag' did not complain when given mutually incompatible set of options.

* 'make check' cannot be run without sparse; people may have meant to say
  'make test' instead, so suggest that.

* Many unsafe call to sprintf() style varargs functions are corrected.

* Also contains quite a few documentation updates.
