Git v1.7.0.4 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Fixes since v1.7.0.3
--------------------

 * Color values given to "color.<cmd>.<slot>" configuration can now have
   more than one attributes (e.g. "bold ul").

 * "git add -u nonexistent-path" did not complain.

 * "git apply --whitespace=fix" didn't work well when an early patch in
   a patch series adds trailing blank lines and a later one depended on
   such a block of blank lines at the end.

 * "git fast-export" didn't check error status and stop when marks file
   cannot be opened.

And other minor fixes and documentation updates.
