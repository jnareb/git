Git v1.7.5.2 Release Notes
==========================

The release notes to 1.7.5.1 forgot to mention:

 * "git stash -p --no-keep-index" and "git stash --no-keep-index -p" now
   mean the same thing.

 * "git upload-pack" (hence "git push" over git native protocol) had a
   subtle race condition that could lead to a deadlock.

Fixes since v1.7.5.1
--------------------

 * "git cvsimport" did not know that CVSNT stores its password file in a
   location different from the traditional CVS.

 * "git diff-files" did not show the mode information from the working
   tree side of an unmerged path correctly.

 * "git diff -M --cached" used to use unmerged path as a possible rename
   source candidate, which made no sense.

 * "git merge-one-file" did not honor GIT_WORK_TREE settings when
   handling a "both sides added, differently" conflict.

 * "git-p4" (in contrib) used a wrong base image while merge a file that
   was added on both branches differently.

 * "git rebase -i -p" failed to preserve the history when there is a
   redundant merge created with the --no-ff option.

And other minor fixes and documentation updates.
