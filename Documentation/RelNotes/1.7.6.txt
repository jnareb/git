Git v1.7.6 Release Notes (draft)
========================

Updates since v1.7.5
--------------------

 * Various git-svn updates.

 * Updates the way content tags are handled in gitweb.

 * Clean-up of the C part of i18n (but not l10n---please wait)
   continues.

 * Processes spawned by "[alias] <name> = !process" in the configuration
   can inspect GIT_PREFIX environment variable to learn where in the
   working tree the original command was invoked.

 * "git blame" learned "--abbrev[=<n>]" option to control the minimum
   number of hexdigits shown for commit object names.

 * "git diff -C -C" used to disable the rename detection entirely when
   there are too many copy candidate paths in the tree; now it falls
   back to "-C" when doing so would keep the copy candidate paths
   under the rename detection limit.

 * "git diff" and its family of commands learned --dirstat=0 to show
   directories that contribute less than 0.1% of changes.

 * "git diff" and its family of commands learned --dirstat=lines mode to
   assess damage to the directory based on number of lines in the patch
   output, not based on the similarity numbers.

 * "git format-patch" learned "--quiet" option to suppress the output of
   the names of generated files.

 * "git format-patch" quotes people's names when it has RFC822 special
   characters in it, e.g. "Junio C. Hamano" <jch@example.com>.  Earlier
   it was up to the user to do this when using its output.

 * "git log" and friends learned a new "--notes" option to replace the
   "--show-notes" option.  Unlike "--show-notes", "--notes=<ref>" does
   not imply showing the default notes.

 * "git merge" learned "-" as a short-hand for "the previous branch", just
   like the way "git checkout -" works.

 * "git rebase" that does not specify on top of which branch to rebase
   the current branch now uses @{upstream} of the current branch.

 * "git rev-list --count" used with "--cherry-mark" counts the cherry-picked
   commits separately, producing more a useful output.

 * "git submodule update" learned "--force" option to get rid of local
   changes in submodules and replace them with the up-to-date version.

 * Compressed tarball gitweb generates is made without the timestamp of
   the tarball generation; snapshot from the same tree should result in
   a same tarball.

Also contains various documentation updates and minor miscellaneous
changes.


Fixes since v1.7.5
------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes in 1.7.5.X maintenance track are
included in this release.

 * "git add -p" did not work correctly when a hunk is split and then
   one of them was given to the editor.
   (merge jc/maint-add-p-overlapping-hunks later)

 * "git add -u" did not resolve a conflict where our history deleted and
   their history modified the same file, and the working tree resolved to
   keep a file.
   (merge jc/fix-add-u-unmerged later)

 * "git config" used to choke with an insanely long line.
   (merge ef/maint-strbuf-init later)

 * "git format-patch" when run with "--quiet" option used to produce a
   nonsense result that consists of alternating empty output.
   (merge early part of cn/format-patch-quiet later)

 * "git format-patch" did not quote RFC822 special characters in the
   email address (e.g From: Junio C. Hamano <jch@example.com>, not
   From: "Junio C. Hamano" <jch@example.com>).
   (merge jk/format-patch-quote-special-in-from later)

 * In "git merge", per-branch branch.<name>.mergeoptions configuration
   variables did not override the fallback default merge.<option>
   configuration variables such as merge.ff, merge.log, etc.
   (merge jc/maint-branch-mergeoptions later)

 * "git mergetool" did not handle conflicted submoudules gracefully.
   (merge jm/mergetool-submodules later)

 * "git send-pack" (hence "git push") over smalt-HTTP protocol could
   deadlock when the client side pack-object died early.
   (merge js/maint-send-pack-stateless-rpc-deadlock-fix later)
