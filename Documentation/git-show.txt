NAME
----
git-show - Show one commit with difference it introduces


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-show' <option>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows commit log and textual diff for a single commit.  The
command internally invokes 'git-rev-list' piped to
'git-diff-tree', and takes command line options for both of
these commands. It also presents the merge commit in a special
format as produced by 'git-diff-tree --cc'.

This manual page describes only the most frequently used options.
