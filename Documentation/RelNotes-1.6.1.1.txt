GIT v1.6.1.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.1
------------------

* "git describe --all" complained when a commit is described with a tag,
  which was nonsense.

* "git log --pretty=format:%s" did not handle a multi-line subject the
  same way as built-in log listers (i.e. shortlog, --pretty=oneline, etc.)

* "git daemon", and "git merge-file" are more careful when freopen fails
  and barf, instead of going on and writing to unopened filehandle.

Other documentation fixes.
