git-reflog(1)
=============

NAME
----
git-reflog - Manage reflog information


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git-reflog' expire [--dry-run]
	[--expire=<time>] [--expire-unreachable=<time>] [--all] <refs>...


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Reflog is a mechanism to record when the tip of branches are
updated.  This command is to manage the information recorded in it.

The subcommand "expire" is used to prune older reflog entries.
Entries older than `expire` time, or entries older than
`expire-unreachable` time and are not reachable from the current
tip, are removed from the reflog.  This is typically not used
directly by the end users -- instead, see gitlink:git-gc[1].



OPTIONS
-------

--expire=<time>::
	Entries older than this time are pruned.  Without the
	option it is taken from configuration `gc.reflogExpire`,
	which in turn defaults to 90 days.

--expire-unreachable=<time>::
	Entries older than this time and are not reachable from
	the current tip of the branch are pruned.  Without the
	option it is taken from configuration
	`gc.reflogExpireUnreachable`, which in turn defaults to
	30 days.

--all::
	Instead of listing <refs> explicitly, prune all refs.
