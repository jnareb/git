GIT v1.6.1.4 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.1.3
--------------------

* "git fast-export" produced wrong output with some parents missing from
  commits, when the history is clock-skewed.

* "git fast-import" sometimes failed to read back objects it just wrote
  out and aborted, because it failed to flush stale cached data.

* "git repack" did not error out when necessary object was missing in the
  repository.

Also includes minor documentation fixes and updates.
