GIT v1.5.5 Release Notes
========================

Updates since v1.5.4
--------------------

(performance)

 * On platforms with suboptimal qsort(3) implementation, there
   is an option to use more reasonable substitute we ship with
   our software.

 * New configuration variable "pack.packsizelimit" can be used
   in place of command line option --max-pack-size.

 * "git fetch" over the native git protocol used to make a
   connection to find out the set of current remote refs and
   another to actually download the pack data.  We now use only
   one connection for these tasks.

 * "git commit" does not run lstat(2) more than necessary
   anymore.

(usability, bells and whistles)

 * You can be warned when core.autocrlf conversion is applied in
   such a way that results in an irreversible conversion.

 * A pattern "foo/" in .gitignore file now matches a directory
   "foo".  Pattern "foo" also matches as before.

 * "git describe" learned to limit the tags to be used for
   naming with --match option.

 * "git describe --contains" now barfs when the named commit
   cannot be described.

 * bash completion's prompt helper function can talk about
   operation in-progress (e.g. merge, rebase, etc.).

 * "git commit" learned a new hook "prepare-commit-msg" that can
   inspect what is going to be committed and prepare the commit
   log message template to be edited.

 * "git gui" learned an auto-spell checking.

 * "git send-email" learned to prompt for passwords
   interactively.

 * "git send-email" learned an easier way to suppress CC
   recipients.

 * Various "git cvsimport", "git cvsexportcommit", "git svn" and
   "git p4" improvements.

(internal)

 * Duplicated code between git-help and git-instaweb that
   launches user's preferred browser has been refactored.

 * It is now easier to write test scripts that records known
   breakages.
