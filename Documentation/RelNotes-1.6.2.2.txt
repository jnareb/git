GIT v1.6.2.2 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.2.1
--------------------

* A longstanding confusing description of what --pickaxe option of
  git-diff does has been clarified in the documentation.

* "git diff --pickaxe-regexp" did not count overlapping matches
  correctly.

* "git-fetch" in a repository that was not cloned from anywhere said
  it cannot find 'origin', which was hard to understand for new people.

* "git-format-patch --numbered-files --stdout" did not have to die of
  incompatible options; it now simply ignores --numbered-files as no files
  are produced anyway.

* "git-ls-files --deleted" did not work well with GIT_DIR&GIT_WORK_TREE.

* "git-read-tree A B C..." without -m option has been broken for a long
  time.

* git-send-email ignored --in-reply-to when --no-thread was given.

* 'git-submodule add' did not tolerate extra slashes and ./ in the path it
  accepted from the command line; it now is more lenient.
