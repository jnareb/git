GIT v1.6.3 Release Notes
========================

With the next major release, "git push" into a branch that is
currently checked out will be refused by default.  You can choose
what should happen upon such a push by setting the configuration
variable receive.denyCurrentBranch in the receiving repository.

To ease the transition plan, the receiving repository of such a
push running this release will issue a big warning when the
configuration variable is missing.  Please refer to:

  http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitFaq#non-bare
  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/107758/focus=108007

for more details on the reason why this change is needed and the
transition plan.

For a similar reason, "git push $there :$killed" to delete the branch
$killed in a remote repository $there, if $killed branch is the current
branch pointed at by its HEAD, gets a large warning.  You can choose what
should happen upon such a push by setting the configuration variable
receive.denyDeleteCurrent in the receiving repository.


Updates since v1.6.2
--------------------

(subsystems)

(performance)

* many uses of lstat(2) in the codepath for "git checkout" have been
  optimized out.

(usability, bells and whistles)

* rsync:/path/to/repo can be used to run git over rsync for local
  repositories.  It may not be useful in practice; meant primarily for
  testing.

* (msysgit) progress output that is sent over the sideband protocol can
  be handled appropriately in Windows console.

* "--pretty=<style>" option to the log family of commands can now be
  spelled as "--format=<style>".  In addition, --format=%formatstring
  is a short-hand for --pretty=tformat:%formatstring.

* "--oneline" is a synonym for "--pretty=oneline --abbrev=commit".

* If you realize that you botched the patch when you are editing hunks
  with the 'edit' action in git-add -i/-p, you can abort the editor to
  tell git not to apply it.

* git-archive learned --output=<file> option.

* git-bisect shows not just the number of remaining commits whose goodness
  is unknown, but also shows the estimated number of remaining rounds.

* You can give --date=<format> option to git-blame.

* git-branch -r shows HEAD symref that points at a remote branch in
  interest of each tracked remote repository.

* git-config learned -e option to open an editor to edit the config file
  directly.

* git-clone runs post-checkout hook when run without --no-checkout.

* git-format-patch can be told to use attachment with a new configuration,
  format.attach.

* git-format-patch can be told to produce deep or shallow message threads.

* git-grep learned to highlight the found substrings in color.

* git-imap-send learned to work around Thunderbird's inability to easily
  disable format=flowed with a new configuration, imap.preformattedHTML.

* git-rebase can be told to rebase the series even if your branch is a
  descendant of the commit you are rebasing onto with --force-rebase
  option.

* git-rebase can be told to report diffstat with the --stat option.

* Output from git-remote command has been vastly improved.

* git-send-email learned --confirm option to review the Cc: list before
  sending the messages out.

(developers)

* Test scripts can be run under valgrind.

* Makefile learned 'coverage' option to run the test suites with
  coverage tracking enabled.

Fixes since v1.6.2
------------------

All of the fixes in v1.6.2.X maintenance series are included in this
release, unless otherwise noted.

Here are fixes that this release has, but have not been backported to
v1.6.2.X series.

* "git diff --pickaxe-regexp" did not count overlapping matches
  correctly (backport by cherry-picking 50fd699).

* "git-fetch" in a repository that was not cloned from anywhere said
  it cannot find 'origin', which was hard to understand for new people.

* git-gc spent excessive amount of time to decide if an object appears
  in a locally existing pack (if needed, backport by merging 69e020a).

* "git-ls-files --deleted" did not work well with GIT_DIR&GIT_WORK_TREE
  (backport by cherry-picking 8ad3dae).

* "git-read-tree A B C..." without -m option has been broken for a long time
  (backport by merging jc/maint-1.6.0-read-tree-overlay)

* 'git-submodule add' did not tolerate extra slashes and ./ in the
  path it accepted from the command line; it now is more lenient
 (if needed, backport by merging db75ada).

* git-send-email ignored --in-reply-to when --no-thread was given
  (backport by merging tr/maint-1.6.0-send-email-irt)
