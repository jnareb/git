git-cherry(1)
=============

NAME
----
git-cherry - Find commits not merged upstream

SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-cherry' [-v] <upstream> [<head>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The changeset (or "diff") of each commit between the fork-point and <head>
is compared against each commit between the fork-point and <upstream>.

Every commit that doesn't exist in the <upstream> branch
has its id (sha1) reported, prefixed by a symbol.  The ones that have
equivalent change already
in the <upstream> branch are prefixed with a minus (-) sign, and those
that only exist in the <head> branch are prefixed with a plus (+) symbol.

Because git-cherry compares the changeset rather than the commit id
(sha1), you can use git-cherry to find out if a commit you made locally
has been applied <upstream> under a different commit id.  For example,
this will happen if you're feeding patches <upstream> via email rather
than pushing or pulling commits directly.


OPTIONS
-------
-v::
	Verbose.

<upstream>::
	Upstream branch to compare against.
