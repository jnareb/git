Git v1.6.6.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.6
------------------

 * "git branch -a name" wasn't diagnosed as an error.

 * "git fast-import" choked when fed a tag that do not point at a
   commit.

 * "git grep" finding from work tree files could have fed garbage to
   the underlying regexec(3).

 * "git grep -L" didn't show empty files (they should never match, and
   they should always appear in -L output as unmatching).

 * http-backend was not listed in the command list in the documentation.

 * Building on FreeBSD (both 7 and 8) needs OLD_ICONV set in the Makefile

 * "git checkout -m some-branch" while on an unborn branch crashed.

Other minor documentation updates are included.
